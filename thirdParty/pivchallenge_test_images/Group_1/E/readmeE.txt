Instructions for the analysis of case B: 
Shear Field
28.10.2000 		okamoto@tokai.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp

Flow Field

 * The flow field was shear field generated by computer.
 * The field parameter is not known.
 * The non-uniform illumination condision was simulated.

Image generation
 * The particle scatter was assumed to be the gaussian distribution.
 * The oclusion particle was considered.
    The intensity of the particles were linerly added.
 * Fill factor was assumed to be 0.7.
 * Particle diameters were randomly determined.
    The histogram of the particle diameter was gaussian distribution.
 * Laser light sheet intensity was assumed to be gaussian.
    Maximum out-of-plane velocity was set to be about 20% of
    laser light thickness.
 * Illumination intensity was varied.


The reference analysis for this case is :

:ev_IS_size_x                           = 16;
:ev_IS_size_y                           = 16;
:ev_IS_size_unit			= "pixel";
:ev_IS_grid_distance_x                	= 8; 
:ev_IS_grid_distance_y               	= 8; 
:ev_IS_grid_distance_unit		= "pixel"; 
:ev_origin_of_evaluation		= 8, 8;
:ev_origin_of_evaluation_units    	= "pixel";
:ev_IS_offset                        	= 0, 0;
:ev_IS_offset_units                	= "pixel";
:ev_cf_fill_ratio                       = 0.7;
